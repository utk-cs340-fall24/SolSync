    - Issue number: #15
    - https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/SolSync/issues/15

## What you did not do
- I was not able to get the current times using new Date() that would serve as the place holders. Instead, I used a static time as the current place holder.

## What problems you encountered
- It took a while to figure out how to add images to the screen and position them correctly
- Learning the difference between padding and margin also took some time for positioning of the text and images

## What you accomplished
For sprint 1, I was in charge of designing and implementing the app's logo, splash screen and the home screen. I designed the icon logo and splash screen on Figma and added the .pngs to the app.json. I also designed the home screen in Figma and used it to create the homescreen in my index.tsx file. For the home screen, there is a place holder for the user's name at the top of the page and there is an image of a sun rising. There are also place holders for the current day's sunrise and sunset as well the next day's sunrise.
