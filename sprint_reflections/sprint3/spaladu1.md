## What you accomplished
For sprint 2, I was in charge of fetching the sunrise sunset data from backend, designing the habits page, and designing and implementing the sign up page. I called the sunrise and sunset data from the API with a hard coded location for this sprint, which I will change to the phone's/user's location in the next sprint. I formatted the homepage to show one linear gradient style from hours 0 to 12 and another linear gradient style from hours 12 to 0. I added an activity indicator that shows a loading symbol while the API call is getting the sunrise and sunset times. I also created designs of the habits pages based on if the user is signed in or not, which will be implemented in the next sprint. Finally, I designed the sign up page and implemented it, allowing users to create their account. It requires a username, email and password. The sign up page can be accessed by clicking the Create an Account button on the sign in page.
