## Contributing

Before contributing, please run the setup-branch-protection.sh script so that you can't commit directly to the main branch.

```bash
./setup-branch-protection.sh
```

If needed, give the script executable permissions using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x setup-branch-protection.sh
```

If on Windows, you can run the script using Git Bash. Note, you may need to add Git Bash to your PATH if the `sh` command is not recognized.

```bash
sh setup-branch-protection.sh
```
