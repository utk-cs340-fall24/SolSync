# Hello Plus - kbae1

## Explanation 
This is a basic React Native app with an intro home page and an updated favicon. The home page displays the sunset and sunrise times by calling a sunrise/sunset API. 

## Purpose for Group Project
Our project is a React Native mobile app. Making this basic app for the Hello Plus assignment helped with 2 things: (1) making sure that I was familiar with installations and setting up a React Native app (which I have never worked with before) and (2) making sure that we could call free APIs that would display the most important information that forms the basis for our project (sunrise/sunset times).

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

> Note: You might have to run `npx expo start --tunnel` if on public WiFi.

### 3. Open the app

Download the "Expo Go" app and scan the QR code to open the app on your phone.
